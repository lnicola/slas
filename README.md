Provides statically allocated vector, matrix and tensor types, for interfacing with blas/blis, in a performant manor, using copy-on-write (aka cow) behaviour.

### Example
**General note:** The `StaticCowVec` type implements `deref` and `deref_mut`, so any method implemented for `[T;LEN]` is also implemented for `StaticCowVec`.

```rust
use slas::prelude::*;
let a = moo![f32: 1, 2, 3.2];
let b = moo![f32: 3, 0.4, 5];
println!("Dot product of {:?} and {:?} is {:?}", a, b, a.dot(&b));
```
[More example code here.](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/slas/blob/master/tests/src/main.rs)

### What is a COW?
The copy-on-write functionality is inspired by [std::borrow::cow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/enum.Cow.html).
The idea is simply that allocations (and time) can be saved, by figuring out when to copy at runtime instead of at compiletime.
This can be memory ineficient at times, but I'm planing on making ways around this in the future.

#### In code...
```rust
let source: Vec<f32> = vec![1., 2., 3.];
let mut v = moo![_ source.as_slice()];

// Here we mutate v,
// so the content of source will be copied into v before the mutation occours.
v[0] = 0.;

assert_eq!(*v, [0., 2., 3.]);
assert_eq!(source, vec![1., 2., 3.]);
```

The borrow checker won't allow mutating `source` after `v` is created, because assignment to borrowed values is not allowed.
This can be a problem in some situations.

```rust
let mut source: Vec<f32> = vec![1., 2., 3.];
let mut v = unsafe { StaticCowVec::<f32, 3>::from_ptr(source.as_ptr()) };

// Here we can mutate source, because v was created from a raw pointer.
source[1] = 3.;
v[0] = 0.;
source[2] = 4.;

assert_eq!(*v, [0., 3., 3.]);
assert_eq!(source, vec![1., 3., 4.]);
```
In the example above, you can see `v` changed value the first time `source` was mutated, but not the second time.
This is because `v` was copied when it was mutated at the line after the first mutation of `source`.

### Matricies, tensors and other mathematical types
At the moment the way I want to implement these types, causes a compiler crash when trying to create 2 objects with the same shape.
For now I'm going to try to create a temporary, and more stable way of dealing with these variations of static multi dimensional arrays.

As of now there is a Matrix type, but no tensor type on the stable branch.
The stable matricies are very basic, as I hopefully will be able to replace them with a more generic tensor type soon...

```rust
 use slas::{prelude::*, matrix::Matrix};

 let m: Matrix<f32, 2, 3> = [
  1., 2., 3.,
  4., 5., 6.
 ].into();

 assert!(m[[1, 0]] == 2.);

 let k: Matrix<f32, 3, 2> = moo![f32: 0..6].into();

 println!("Product of {:?} and {:?} is {:?}", m, k, m * k);
```

If you want a look at whats to come in the future,
you can go [here](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/slas/tree/experimental/src/experimental)
for some *very* experimental source code for the project.

### Test and Benchmark it yourself!
You can get benchmark results and tests by running
`cargo test -p tests` and `cargo bench -p tests`
in the root of the repository.

### TODO: before publishing ðŸŽ‰
- ~~Move ./experimental to other branch~~
- ~~Implement Debug for matrix~~
- ~~Fix matrix api (Column and row specification is weird)~~
- ~~Write documentation~~
- Benchmark against ndarray - and maybe others? numpy?

### TODO: after publish
- Feature support for conversion between [ndarray](lib.rs/ndarray) types
- Allow for use on stable channel - perhabs with a stable feature
- Implement stable tensors - perhabs for predefined dimensions with a macro
- Make StaticCowVec backed by a union -so that vectors that are always owned can also be supported (useful for memory critical systems, fx. embeded devices).

### TODO: Long term
- GPU support - maybe with cublas
